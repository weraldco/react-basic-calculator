## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Search for weather information by entering a location in the search bar
- View current weather conditions including temperature, weather icon, and location details
- See additional weather metrics like "feels like" temperature, humidity percentage, wind speed, and precipitation amounts
- Browse a 7-day weather forecast with daily high/low temperatures and weather icons
- View an hourly forecast showing temperature changes throughout the day
- Switch between different days of the week using the day selector in the hourly forecast section
- Toggle between Imperial and Metric measurement units via the units dropdown
- Switch between specific temperature units (Celsius and Fahrenheit) and measurement units for wind speed (km/h and mph) and precipitation (millimeters) via the units dropdown
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

My process is just simple, I focus first in fetching datas that I will need in this site, I use reduxtoolkit as state manager, after I finish the fetching function I go to UI Structuring, I first build the desktop design, then after I finish building the desktop design I work in mobile responsiveness. I also add voice button.

### Built with

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Taiwind CSS
- Typescript
- ReduxToolkit

### What I learned

I learn how to use voice button, and also the auto get the current location using the google chrome location features.

### Continued development

I wanted to experiment in this project, maybe adding a theme switcher.
